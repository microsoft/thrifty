/**
 * HTTP implementation of the TTransport interface. Used for working with a
 * Thrift web services implementation (using for example TServlet).
 *
 * THIS IMPLEMENTATION IS NOT THREAD-SAFE !!!
 *
 * Based on the official thrift java THttpTransport with the apache client support removed.
 * Both due to wanting to avoid the additional dependency as well as it being a bit weird to have two
 * implementations to switch between in the same class.
 *
 * Uses HttpURLConnection internally
 *
 * Also note that under high load, the HttpURLConnection implementation
 * may exhaust the open file descriptor limit.
 *
 * @see [THRIFT-970](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/THRIFT-970)
